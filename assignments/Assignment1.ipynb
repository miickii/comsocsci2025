    "> 1. Inspect the HTML of the page and use web-scraping to get the names of all researchers that contributed to the conference in 2023. The goal is the following: (i) get as many names as possible including: keynote speakers, chairs, authors of parallel talks and authors of posters; (ii) ensure that the collected names are complete and accuarate as reported in the website (e.g. both first name and family name); (iii) ensure that no name is repeated multiple times with slightly different spelling. \n",

    ">    * You can use the [find_all](https://www.crummy.com/software/BeautifulSoup/bs4/doc/#find-all) method to find elements that match specific filters. Check the [documentation](https://www.crummy.com/software/BeautifulSoup/bs4/doc/) of the library for detailed explanations on how to set filters.  \n",
    ">    * Parse the strings to ensure that you retrieve \"clean\" author names (e.g. remove commas, or other unwanted charachters)\n",
    ">    * The overall idea is to adapt the procedure I have used [here](https://nbviewer.org/github/lalessan/comsocsci2023/blob/master/additional_notebooks/ScreenScraping.ipynb) for the specific page you are scraping. \n",
    "> 3. Create the set of unique researchers that joined the conference and *store it into a file*.\n",
    ">     * *Important:* If you notice any issue with the list of names you have collected (e.g. duplicate/incorrect names), come up with a strategy to clean your list as much as possible. \n",
    "> 4. *Optional:* For a more complete represenation of the field, include in your list: (i) the names of researchers from the programme committee of the conference, that can be found at [this link](https://ic2s2-2023.org/program_committee); (ii) the organizers of tutorials, that can be found at [this link](https://ic2s2-2023.org/tutorials)\n",
    "> 5. How many unique researchers do you get?\n",
    "> 6. Explain the process you followed to web-scrape the page. Which choices did you make to accurately retreive as many names as possible? Which strategies did you use to assess the quality of your final list? Explain your reasoning and your choices __(answer in max 150 words)__."

    "> **Exercise : Collecting Research Articles from IC2S2 Authors**\n",
    ">\n",
    ">In this exercise, we'll leverage the OpenAlex API to gather information on research articles authored by participants of the IC2S2 2024 (NOT 2023) conference, referred to as *IC2S2 authors*. **Before you start, please ensure you read through the entire exercise.**\n",
    ">\n",
    "> \n",
    "> **Steps:**\n",
    ">  \n",
    "> 1. **Retrieve Data:** Starting with the *authors* you identified in Week 2, Exercise 2, use the OpenAlex API [works endpoint](https://docs.openalex.org/api-entities/works) to fetch the research articles they have authored. For each article, retrieve the following details:\n",
    ">    - _id_: The unique OpenAlex ID for the work.\n",
    ">    - _publication_year_: The year the work was published.\n",
    ">    - _cited_by_count_: The number of times the work has been cited by other works.\n",
    ">    - _author_ids_: The OpenAlex IDs for the authors of the work.\n",
    ">    - _title_: The title of the work.\n",
    ">    - _abstract_inverted_index_: The abstract of the work, formatted as an inverted index.\n",
    "> \n",
    ">     **Important Note on Paging:** By default, the OpenAlex API limits responses to 25 works per request. For more efficient data retrieval, I suggest to adjust this limit to 200 works per request. Even with this adjustment, you will need to implement pagination to access all available works for a given query. This ensures you can systematically retrieve the complete set of works beyond the initial 200. Find guidance on implementing pagination [here](https://docs.openalex.org/how-to-use-the-api/get-lists-of-entities/paging#cursor-paging).\n",
    ">\n",
    "> 2. **Data Storage:** Organize the retrieved information into two Pandas DataFrames and save them to two files in a suitable format:\n",
    ">    - The *IC2S2 papers* dataset should include: *id, publication\\_year, cited\\_by\\_count, author\\_ids*.\n",
    ">    - The *IC2S2 abstracts* dataset should include: *id, title, abstract\\_inverted\\_index*.\n",
    ">  \n",
    ">\n",
    "> **Filters:**\n",
    "> To ensure the data we collect is relevant and manageable, apply the following filters:\n",
    "> \n",
    ">    - Only include *IC2S2 authors* with a total work count between 5 and 5,000.\n",
    ">    - Retrieve only works that have received more than 10 citations.\n",
    ">    - Limit to works authored by fewer than 10 individuals.\n",
    ">    - Include only works relevant to Computational Social Science (focusing on: Sociology OR Psychology OR Economics OR Political Science) AND intersecting with a quantitative discipline (Mathematics OR Physics OR Computer Science), as defined by their [Concepts](https://docs.openalex.org/api-entities/works/work-object#concepts). *Note*: here we only consider Concepts at *level=0* (the most coarse definition of concepts). \n",
    ">\n",
    "> **Efficiency Tips:**\n",
    "> Writing efficient code in this exercise is **crucial**. To speed up your process:\n",
    "> - **Apply filters directly in your request:** When possible, use the [filter parameter](https://docs.openalex.org/api-entities/works/filter-works) of the *works* endpoint to apply the filters above directly in your API request, ensuring only relevant data is returned. Learn about combining multiple filters [here](https://docs.openalex.org/how-to-use-the-api/get-lists-of-entities/filter-entity-lists).  \n",
    "> - **Bulk requests:** Instead of sending one request for each author, you can use the [filter parameter](https://docs.openalex.org/api-entities/works/filter-works) to query works by multiple authors in a single request. *Note: My testing suggests that can only include up to 25 authors per request.*\n",
    "> - **Use multiprocessing:** Implement multiprocessing to handle multiple requests simultaneously. I highly recommmend [Joblibâ€™s Parallel](https://joblib.readthedocs.io/en/stable/) function for that, and [tqdm](https://tqdm.github.io/) can help monitor progress of your jobs. Remember to stay within [the rate limit](https://docs.openalex.org/how-to-use-the-api/rate-limits-and-authentication) of 10 requests per second.\n",

    ">\n",
    ">   \n",
    "> For reference, employing these strategies allowed me to fetch the data in about 30 seconds using 5 cores on my laptop. I obtained a dataset of approximately 25 MB (including both the *IC2S2 abstracts* and *IC2S2 papers* files).\n",
    "> \n",
    ">\n",
    "> **Data Overview and Reflection questions:** Answer the following questions: \n",
    "> - **Dataset summary.** How many works are listed in your *IC2S2 papers* dataframe? How many unique researchers have co-authored these works? \n",
    "> - **Efficiency in code.** Describe the strategies you implemented to make your code more efficient. How did your approach affect your code's execution time? __(answer in max 150 words)__\n",
    "> - **Filtering Criteria and Dataset Relevance** Reflect on the rationale behind setting specific thresholds for the total number of works by an author, the citation count, the number of authors per work, and the relevance of works to specific fields. How do these filtering criteria contribute to the relevance of the dataset you compiled? Do you believe any aspects of Computational Social Science research might be underrepresented or overrepresented as a result of these choices? __(answer in max 150 words)__\n"

    ">    - If the network is disconnected, how many connected components does it have? A connected component is defined as a subset of nodes within the network where a path exists between any pair of nodes in that subset. \n",
    ">    - How many isolated nodes are there in your network?  An isolated node is defined as a node with no connections to any other node in the network.\n",
