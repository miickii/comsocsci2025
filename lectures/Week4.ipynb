    "> 1. **Network Metrics:**\n",
    ">    - What is the total number of nodes (authors) and links (collaborations) in the network? \n",
    "\n",
    "Number of nodes is 16190, and number of links is 65448\n",
    "\n",
    ">    - Calculate the network's density (the ratio of actual links to the maximum possible number of links). Would you say that the network is sparse? Justify your answer.\n",
    "\n",
    "The network density is 0.000499, which means that the actual links is far from the possible number of links, so the network is sparse.\n",
    "\n",
    ">    - Is the network fully connected (i.e., is there a direct or indirect path between every pair of nodes within the network), or is it disconnected?\n",
    "\n",
    "The network is not fully connected\n",
    "\n",
    ">    - If the network is disconnected, how many connected components does it have? A connected component is defined as a subset of nodes within the network where a path exists between any pair of nodes in that subset. \n",
    "\n",
    "There are 111 connected components\n",
    "\n",
    ">    - How many isolated nodes are there in your network?  An isolated node is defined as a node with no connections to any other node in the network.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are zero isolated nodes\n",
    "\n",
    ">    - Discuss the results above on network density, and connectivity. Are your findings in line with what you expected? Why? \n",
    "\n",
    "The low density makes sense, since many authors have only collaborated with a smaller subset of the total amount of authors. The network not being fully connected also makes sense due to geography, and teams of researchers that have only collaborated between each others.\n",
    "\n",
    "> \n",
    "> 3. **Degree Analysis:**\n",
    ">    - Compute the average, median, mode, minimum, and maximum degree of the nodes. Perform the same analysis for node strength (weighted degree). What do these metrics tell us about the network?\n",

    "Degree - Average: 8.084990735021618, Median: 6.0, Mode: 4, Min: 1, Max: 339\n",
    "Strength - Average: 15.537615812229772, Median: 8.0, Mode: 4, Min: 1, Max: 600\n",
    "\n",
    "This means that on average each author has collaborated with 8 other authors. The most common degree is 4, suggesting that many authors have collaborated with exactly 4 other authors, showing a typical small team size.\n",
    "\n",
    "The average strength is larger than the average degree, indicating that many authors have multiple strong collaborations. The median strength is higher than the median degree, showing that even authors with fewer collaborators may have stronger or repeated collaborations. The most collaborative author has a strength of 600\n",
